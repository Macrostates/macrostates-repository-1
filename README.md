# Repository specification package

This package describes reusable conventions for a source code repository. It is
intended for projects that want the same baseline hygiene, configuration,
compatibility, and version control expectations.

## Macrostates

This package is part of [Macrostates](https://github.com/orgs/Macrostates), a
project for composing reusable specification packages into specs-driven
development projects.

## Scope

- Repository self-containment.
- Configuration and secret hygiene.
- Generated and local file boundaries.
- Root repository contents.
- Repository documentation.
- Git usage.
- Compatibility surfaces.
- Commit hygiene.

Language-specific rules, process rules, and domain-specific behavior are out of
scope for this package.

## Macrostates artifacts

Follow the selected Meta package's project layout: numbered specification
packages and the project entrypoint are tracked under `.macrostates/specs/`.
Implementation documentation, decisions, workflows and release declarations,
when required by project rules, live under `.macrostates/implementation/`.
Application source, tests, build configuration and runtime configuration retain
their language/tool locations outside `.macrostates/`. This package does not
make the Macrostates CLI mandatory or change the scope of a subproject.
